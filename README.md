# Severus Experiment

Since github's Copilot is no more free of charge and [I was to cheap too pay $10 a month](https://haghiri75.com/en/i-was-to-cheap-to-pay-10-a-month-for-copilot-so-i-made-my-own/) for a decent subscription, I have decided to come up with my idea of an _AI pair programmer_. This repository, serves as every phase of the _Severus Experiment_. 

## The name

I haven't been a big fan of Harry Potter franchise, nor the wizarding world at all. But recently, I re-watched the whole franchise and I found my favorite character to be _Severus Snape_. This is the only reason this project is called _Severus_ and there is no witchcraft and wizardry in the project.

## The idea

The whole idea is to create a completely _free_ version of Copilot. So I used [BigScience's BLOOM](https://huggingface.com/bigscience/bloom) as the language model and I got pretty good results.
