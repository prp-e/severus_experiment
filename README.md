# Severus Experiment

Since github's Copilot is no more free of charge and [I was to cheap too pay $10 a month](https://haghiri75.com/en/i-was-to-cheap-to-pay-10-a-month-for-copilot-so-i-made-my-own/) for a decent subscription, I have decided to come up with my idea of an _AI pair programmer_. This repository, serves as every phase of the _Severus Experiment_.
